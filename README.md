This repo is developed to modify the original EasyList.

The modified EasyList removes the line "||imasdk.googleapis.com^" from the original EasyList, so that video players on many websites won't be affected by this rule.

The modified EasyList will be automatically updated every day. If the original EasyList changed, a new modified list will be pushed accordingly. 

You can download the modified EasyList at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/haomuch/easylist-revised/refs/heads/main/modified_easylist.txt
